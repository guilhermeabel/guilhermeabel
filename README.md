# hey, I'm **Abel**

This is my personal profile, where i keep my own projects.

My professional profile is: [@abel-tiny](https://github.com/abel-tiny)

I really enjoy making things run faster and as cost-efficient as possible ðŸš€

I'm a full-stack software developer since 2018. 

I'm experienced in building scalable applications and refactoring critical legacy systems using advanced architectural techniques.

These skills allow me to craft maintainable software with peak performance.

Technologies I mostly work with are PHP 8+, Golang, Node.js for backend, TypeScript, JavaScript, and React for frontend, and Redis for memory NoSQL cache DB with MySQL 8 for relational/disk storage.

I'm very familiar with DevOps infrastructure and networks, having developed CI/CD pipelines, unit and integration tests, and composing Docker environments for efficient resource utilization, as well as service health checks, API gateway implementation, load balancing, and more.
